LLMstack has been designed as an API first platform. Most of the feature are exposed as a REST API and can be accessed via the webapp or directly via the API. Hence any app built using LLMStack can be accessed via the API. The API for an application support a streaming mode and a non streaming mode. 
In streaming mode, the API will return a stream of data as soon as data is available from any processor. In non streaming mode, the API will return the output of the application once the application has completed processing.
