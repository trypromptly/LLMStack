An application is a high level abstraction the allows user to chain multiple processors together to build a complex workflow. An application is built using a simple form builder. The form builder allows users to add processors and configure them. The form builder also allows users to add a custome input form for the application. Once an application is published, it can be accessed via a webapp or an API. In addition users can also configure the application to be triggered via Slack or Discord.
