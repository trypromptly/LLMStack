If you are on social media following Generative AI related news, you would have come across [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/) and their [Realtime Avatars](https://www.heygen.com/article/unleashing-the-power-of-realtime-avatars) which is a game changer in the field of video generation.

Today we are excited to announce that we are adding support for HeyGen's Realtime Avatars in LLMStack / Promptly. You can now use HeyGen's Realtime Avatars to generate videos with your avatar repeating the answer in realtime.
